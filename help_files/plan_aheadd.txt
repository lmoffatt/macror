Plan ahead:

1. Background
Jeronimo suggested strongly to improve the documentation, specially to add an elaborate explanation of each command

He wants a progress bar for commands that takes a while.

Avoid screen freezing

----
We also disscused and we decided we want five screens:
1. Models screen
2. Protocols screen
3. Measurements screen
4. Simulations screen
5. Analysis screen

Each screen would have its own set of commands

---
Major changes ahead
1. Split class Experiment in three: ExperimentalProtocol, SamplingSchedule, and SignalValue.

2. Set windows for models, protocols, measurements, simulations and analysis.

3. Simplify the excess of classes.
