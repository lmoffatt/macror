option likelihood [new-alias]
      Creates an object comprised by different options chosen regarding
      likelihood approximation.


"Likelihood_Algorithm"
      [label]
      Select the algorithm used for caculating the likelihood.
      Valid labels
      "MacroDR"
	  Macroscopic Double anchor Recursive. It recursively calculates the
	  likelihood of each step (taking into account the previous
	  measurement) considering two anchors for the state of the
	  preparation: at the begining and at the end of each measure.
      "MacroR"
	  Macroscopic Recursive. It recursively calculates the likelihood of
	  each step (taking into account the previous measurement). It only
	  considering the state of the preparation at the begining of each step.
      "MacroNR"
	  Macroscopic Non-Recursive. It independently calculates the likelihood
	  of each step without taking into account previous measurements.

"Is_Avaraging"
      [boolean]
      If true it assumes that the measured current correspond to a temporal
      average for computing the likelihood. If false it does not perform
      this correct

"Use_Zero_Guard"
      [boolean]
      if true it prevents the mean probability of being on each state to be less
      than zero or more than one.

"Delta_x_for_score"
      [real]
      Uses the designated value as differential x for numerically computing
      the score( i.e., the partial derivative of the likelihood repective to
      the optimized parameters.
