>>help model patch

Command model starts the interactive creation of a patch

model patch [model-alias]
    Creates a model referred by an alias. It succesively ask for a name, the
    channel model, the number of channels and the noise of the preparation.

    Try help model channel for description of the channel model.

    Although the noise is considered white and gaussian, and therefore
    described with a single parameter, for convenience it ask for two
    parameters so the standard deviation and the frequency at which this
    standard deviation holds.

    The number of channels can be a fractional number, because it represents
    not the actual number but our best guess of it, and therefore it might be
    between two numbers.
    When the number of channels is used for simulations, it is rounded to the
    nearest integer.
