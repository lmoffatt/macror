>>help option optimize

Command option optimize starts the interactive creation of an optimization
options object

option optimize [new-alias]
    Creates an option list referred by an alias. It succesively ask for
    different options of the likelihood calculation (detailed on help option
    likelihood), options on the iterations on the likelihodd maximization and
    options for the termination of the optimization.

Likelihood options

"Likelihood_Algorithm"
    [label]
    Select the algorithm used for caculating the likelihood.
    Valid labels
    "MacroDR"
	  Macroscopic Double anchor Recursive. It recursively calculates the
	  likelihood of each step (taking into account the previous
	  measurement) considering two anchors for the state of the
	  preparation: at the begining and at the end of each measure.
    "MacroR"
	  Macroscopic Recursive. It recursively calculates the likelihood of
	  each step (taking into account the previous measurement). It only
	  considering the state of the preparation at the begining of each step.
    "MacroNR"
	  Macroscopic Non-Recursive. It independently calculates the likelihood
	  of each step without taking into account previous measurements.

"Is_Avaraging"
    [boolean]
    If true it assumes that the measured current correspond to a temporal
    average for computing the likelihood. If false it does not perform
    this correct

"Use_Zero_Guard"
    [boolean]
    if true it prevents the mean probability of being on each state to be less
    than zero or more than one.

"Delta_x_for_score"
    [real]
    Uses the designated value as differential x for numerically computing
    the score( i.e., the partial derivative of the likelihood repective to
    the optimized parameters.

Optimization step options
"Hessian_update"
    [label]
    Uses different approaches to calculate the Hessian, i.e, the second
    derivative of the optimized function (i.e, the logLikelihood), with
    respect to the parameters.
    Valid labels:
    "BFGS"
	   Uses the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno approximation to the
	   Hessian.

"Initial_step_length"
    [real]
    Value for the step length given at the begining of the optimization

Line search termination condition parameters.
"Maximum_evaluations_per_loop"
    [count]
    Condition to stop the line search loop. In this case when it when the
    number of evaluations surpasses this number.

"Wolf_condition_c1"
    [real]
    Parameter c1 of the frist Wolf condition, the Armijo rule.


"Wolf_condition_c2"
    [real]
    Parameter c2 of the second Wolf condition, the curvature condition.

Optimization termination options
"Termination_condition"
    [label]
    Strategy for deciding how to determine the termination condition
    Valid labels:
    "Threshold"
	It stops the optimization if one of the thresholds is crossed.


"Maximum_number_of_evaluations"
    [count]
    Stops the optimization when the total number of likelihood evaluations
    reaches this number

"Maximum_number_of_iterations"
    [count]
    Stops the optimization when the number of iterations of the optimization
    algorithm reaches this number.


"resolution_in_LogL"
    [real]
    Stops the optimization if either the expected reduction in the
    log-likelihood for the next iteration or the actual reduction in the last
    iteration is less than this value.

"resolution_in_gradient"
    [real]
    Stops the optimization if the norm of the computed gradient is less than
    this value.

"resolution_in_x"
    [real]
    Stops the optimization if the last biggest change of all parameters values
    is less than this value.

"resolution_in_step"
    [real]
    Stops the optimization if the value of the adaptive step length is less
    than this value.
