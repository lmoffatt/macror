Command model starts the interactive creation of a model

model channel [model-alias]
    Creates a model referred by an alias. It succesively ask for a name, the
    Q-matrix, the g-matrix and the a-matrix. The default alias is mymodel

    Q-matrix is a square matrix of k dimensions, where Q(i,j) represents the
    rate constant for going from the state i to the state j in a 1 micromolar
    solution of the agonist.

    g-matrix is a column vector of k elements g(i) representing the single
    channel current for the state i.

    a-matrix is a row vector of k elements a(i) representing the number of
    agonist bound for state i.
