# Introduction #
The names of the files where the different objects of Macro-R are stored, loaded and saved (i.e, kinetic models, experimetal and simulated data, algorithms options and statistical analysis results) are enforced to  follow some guidelines. The idea is to find a set of rules uniquely determine a name for both a published or unpublished kinetic model or results. The rules should be also intuitive, easy to follow and easy to remember. Also the rules should be unambiguous and very general and possibly automatically determined by context information.
The rules should also


# Details #
The best rule we could come up with is the following:

Author+Date+idNumber

## Author ##
If the model, the data or the algorithm is taken from a publication, we use **ONLY** the first author last name (not the asterisk author, nor the last author, the first author is easy to follow with less amount of information). We also only use the last name, because the first might not be easily available.
In the case of unpublished data, the Author self identify.

## Date ##
the date is the earliest date that appears in the paper, usually first reception. We think that the earliest date, the priority principle, is the easiest to remember. In the case of unpublished data, it is just the first date of the creation of the model or the date of the data recording or the date of the simulation.

## idNumber ##

id numbers starts like that
Mengano\_20101027\_01
Mengano\_20101027\_02
Mengano\_20101027\_10
Mengano\_20101027\_104

since it is likely to expect more than ten models or data sets per publication or work day, but not very likely more than a hundred. In any case, the only problem with more than a hundred per day is just that the objects will look mixed when sorted by name, but they can always be sorted by time.
