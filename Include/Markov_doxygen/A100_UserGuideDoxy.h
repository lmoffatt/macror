  \page user_guide_page  User Manual

  The user manual explains how to use MacroR. It is composed by several
sections:

*   - Section @subpage use_cases_page Use Cases gives an account of some
scenarios where MacroR might be usefull.

*   - Section @subpage installation_page discusses how to download, compile and
install MacroR for your platform.


*   - Section @subpage hands_on_page "Hands on" shows how to run pre-packaged
Examples, and how to play with them to have a feeling of what MacroR can do.


*   - Section @subpage console_vs_gui_page ""Console vs GUI" discusses the use of
the Console and Graphic interfases

*   - Section \subpage abc_kinettic_fitting_page "ABC of Kinetic Fitting"
explains how to specify a kinetic model, read or simulate electrophysiology
data and determine the kinetic parameters of the proposed model that better
describe the data.
*
*    - Section \subpage kinetic_models_task_page "Kinetic Models" explains with more
detail how to read, build and manipulate arbitrary Kinetic Models
*
    - Section \subpage recordings_task_page "Recordings" show how you can tell
MacroR the information it need to know to interpret your recordings.

   -   Section  \subpage simulations_task_page "Simulations" show how to run
simulations of electrophysiological recordings" based on a
given Kinetic Model and a given pattern of estimulation.

-   Section \subpage maximum_likelihood_estimation_task_page
"Maximum Likelihood Estimation" indicates the procedure to Calculate different approximations to
 the Maximum Likelihood Estimates
 of the kinetics parameters of a particular kinetic model on a simulated or actual electrophysiological recording.

-   Section \subpage models_search_task_page "Find the Best Models" discuss different strategies to determine which models are supported by the data and which not. the kinetic model

-   Section \subpage remote_control_task_page "Remote control" shows how to
configure things so the program can manage smoothly the distribution of jobs
among different processors where the user might have have remote access to.

-   Section \subpage graphic_representation_task_page "Graphic Representation"
describe different graphic representations of experimental and simulated data,
algorithm performance, likelihood landscapes and Model comparison.

-  Section \subpage FAQ_page "Frequently Asked Questions" gives answers to
frequently asked questions.

-  Section \subpage Troubleshooting_page Troubleshooting tells you what to do
when you have
problems.

-  Section \subpage glossary_page Glossary explains key concepts for
understanding MacroR subtleties.
