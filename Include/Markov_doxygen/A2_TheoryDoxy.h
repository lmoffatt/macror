/**
 \page mol_kinetics_definition Molecular Kinetics
  Molecules change their conformational state upon internal decays and random colision with other molecules. Molecular
  Kinetics is described by the rate of change of states at different conditions.
  Kinetic models describe the rules that govern the evolution of the conformational state of a molecule. The simplest
  kinetic models map all the possible conformational states on a limited number of them with distinct physico-chemical
  properties and describe the probabilities of interconversion between the different states.
