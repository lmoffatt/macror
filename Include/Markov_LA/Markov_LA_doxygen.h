*
*   It was developed for the necessary Matrix operations for Markov Modelling
*   and Bayesian Statistics analysis
*   It allows to add, substract, multiply, transpose Matrices.
*   Calculates eigenvalues, Matrix exponential and  Matrix inverse

 This file contains all the things that make Matrix a Regular type and invariant
 mechanisms:
    - Its class definition, which includes:
	  Default constructor, copy constructor and destructor
	  Element access by one or two indexes
    - Friend functions that allow to determine limits for the indexes
	  size, ncols and nrows
    - Equality and Minor operators completely based on the public interface

  Besides that, the class includes several Constructors based on data, and an
asigment to value operator
    -
the definition of the class Matrix, and the Equality operator
